# Convolutional-channel-coding-and-viterbi-decoder-implementation
A MATLAB implementation for convolutional channel coding and viterbi decoder from scratch. 

The implementation of the convolutional Encoder/Decoder enables using any prefered generative polynomials.
The dimensions of the generative polynomials used specify implictly the constraint length (K) in addition to the
information rate r

A report is added to the repository to show/simulate the process of using the functions generated.
